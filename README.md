# ðŸ“ˆ AI-Powered Stock Trend Predictor

# Overview  

This project is a **machine-learning based stock trend predictor** that utilizes a **Random Forest regression** to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on real stock market data and is accessible using a **Flask Web App**, allowing users to input stock symbols and receive a predicted closing price.

# Features

Predicts stock closing prices using machine learning (Random Forest)
Fetches real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance)
Simple **Flask web interface** for user input
Supports **multiple stock symbols** (Not just AAPL)
Interactive charts to illustrate stock trends (Planned)
JavaScript enhancements for better UI/UX (Planned)
**Temporary CSV storage** to manage stock data efficiently (Planned)
